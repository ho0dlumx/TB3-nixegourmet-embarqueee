# How to Run
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Configure the Arduino IDE by going to `File > Preferences > Additional boards manager URLs` and add the following URL: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`.
2. Install the ESP32 board support in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the ESP32 Wrover Module as your target board in the IDE settings.

# Developer's Guide
To execute the code, update the WiFi network name and password. Enter 'com' as the barcode input to perform a functionality test. The code simulates the reading of a barcode and accessing a web page related to the scanned product on the company's website. Since the developed website is not hosted, the test is being conducted using the LinkedIn website as a placeholder. There's a picture of how the board must be connected in the computer in the files.
